This Python program performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher technique. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It defines two functions: encryption() and decryption(), which take a plain text or cipher text and a shift key as input, respectively.

2. The encryption() function shifts each letter in the plain text by the specified shift key to generate the cipher text. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

3. The decryption() function reverses the encryption process by shifting each letter in the cipher text back to its original position using the inverse of the shift key.

4. The program then prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption, enter the message, and specify the shift key.

5. After performing the encryption or decryption, it asks if the user wants to continue or exit.

6. If the user chooses to exit, the program ends with a goodbye message.

To use this program, users can follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt their messages by specifying the desired operation, inputting the text, and providing the shift key.
